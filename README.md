# **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm**  

The **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm** is a line-drawing method commonly used in computer graphics to create a straight line between two given points. It is straightforward and effective, working by calculating small, incremental changes in the x and y coordinates of the endpoints to plot the line precisely. By incrementally computing and plotting points, the DDA algorithm efficiently generates smooth line segments.  

## **Algorithm**  

#### **Step 1:** Enter the coordinates of the two points, \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \).  

#### **Step 2:** Calculate the change in x and y:  
   - \( dx = x_2 - x_1 \)  
   - \( dy = y_2 - y_1 \)  

#### **Step 3:** Find the slope of the line:  
   - \( m = \frac{dy}{dx} \)  

#### **Step 4:** Begin drawing from the starting point \( (x_1, y_1) \).  

#### **Step 5:** Draw the line:  
   - Move step-by-step along the x-axis, increasing \( x \) by 1 each time.  
   - For each new \( x \), find the corresponding \( y \) using the formula:  
     \[
     y = y_1 + m \times (x - x_1)
     \]  

#### **Step 6:** Mark each \( (x, y) \) point on the graph to form the line.  

#### **Step 7:** Continue this process until reaching the endpoint \( (x_2, y_2) \).
